# vfdeps-win-noz3
OCaml-based VeriFast dependencies, sans Z3

This repository contains the build script for building OCaml and the OCaml-based packages needed to build [VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast) on Windows, except for Z3. The full set of dependencies, including Z3, are built by [vfdeps-win](https://github.com/verifast/vfdeps-win).

The Travis CI build script deploys the produced binary to [Bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/verifast/verifast).

For the Linux and macOS version, see [vfdeps](https://github.com/verifast/vfdeps).
